# E1-F1-S1 Initialize Vite + Vue 3 + TypeScript PWA scaffold with Vuetify and core dependencies

## User Story

As a platform engineer, I want a fresh Vite-based Vue 3 + TypeScript project with foundational dependencies pre-installed so that the team can start iterating on the SaaS PWA without manual bootstrapping.

## Related Epic

- [E1](./E1.md) – SaaS platform foundation epic for the scaffold and tooling effort.

## Related Feature

- [E1-F1](./E1-F1.md) – Project scaffold and configuration feature.

## Scope

- Create a new Vite project configured for Vue 3 + TypeScript and PWA readiness.
- Add Vuetify 3, Pinia, Vue Router, Vee-Validate, Vue I18n, VueUse, Lodash, Luxon, and supporting TypeScript typings.
- Ensure npm project metadata (package.json, README update) reflects the SaaS scaffold purpose.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `package.json` contains dependencies for Vue 3, Vuetify 3, TypeScript, Vite, Pinia, Vue Router, Vee-Validate, Vue I18n, VueUse, Lodash, and Luxon using latest stable releases.
- Base Vite config initializes Vue plugin and TypeScript support; project builds via `npm run build` out of the box.
- Default App entry renders a minimal placeholder view demonstrating Vuetify is wired (e.g., a single component or layout placeholder) without committing to product UI.
- Project scripts include `watch`, `build`, and `preview` wired to Vite.

## Notes

- Keep UI minimal—focus on wiring dependencies, not design or business flows.
- Do not introduce opinionated routing or state structure yet beyond default placeholders.
