# E3-F6-S2 Responsive layout, focus management, and toast/alert feedback patterns

## User Story

As a user, I want the tonal builder to stay usable across screen sizes with clear feedback for actions so I can confidently tweak scales on any device.

## Related Epic

- [E3](./E3.md) – Tonal scale builder migration epic.

## Related Feature

- [E3-F6](./E3-F6.md) – Theming, responsiveness, and UX polish feature.

## Scope

- Refine responsive layouts for pickers, control panels, strips, cards, modals, and context menu to match prototype polish.
- Add toast/alert patterns for copy successes, invalid imports, and other transient feedback using Headless UI primitives styled with Tailwind.
- Implement keyboard focus management for modals, menus, and hover-driven elements to ensure accessibility.
- Document key responsive breakpoints and feedback triggers for QA reference.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Layout adapts for desktop/tablet widths without overlapping controls; scroll regions and hover zoom remain usable on narrower viewports.
- Toasts/alerts appear for clipboard actions and import errors with non-blocking timing and are dismissible/accessibly announced.
- Modals and context menus trap focus appropriately and return focus to the triggering control when closed.
- Tests or manual QA scripts cover responsive breakpoints, focus handling, and feedback visibility for key interactions.

## Notes

- Responsive behaviors, focus flows, and feedback timing must mirror the `temp/` app; rebuild them with Tailwind/Headless UI while keeping the experience 1:1.
