# E1-F5-S1 Configure Vue I18n for localization with sample locales and loading strategy

## User Story

As a global-ready product owner, I want localization scaffolding with Vue I18n so that future features can ship with multilingual support from the start.

## Related Epic

- [E1](./E1.md) – SaaS platform foundation epic for the scaffold and tooling effort.

## Related Feature

- [E1-F5](./E1-F5.md) – Localization and PWA experience feature.

## Scope

- Install and configure Vue I18n with TypeScript support and lazy-loading-ready structure for locale messages.
- Provide sample locale files for `en` and `fr` with neutral placeholder strings for the shell.
- Add composables/helpers for switching locales and persisting the selection (e.g., localStorage) without business coupling.

## Acceptance Criteria

- I18n plugin is registered in the app entry with default locale and fallback strategy defined.
- Locale files are organized for scalability and can be extended without refactoring.
- Example component demonstrates reading translated strings and switching between `en` and `fr`.
- Documentation covers how to add locales, manage dynamic imports, and test translations.

## Notes

- Keep content neutral; avoid domain-specific copy.
- Ensure interoperability with Vee-Validate for future localized validation messages.
