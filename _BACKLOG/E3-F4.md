# E3-F4 Scale visualization and interaction patterns feature

## Feature Statement

As a UI engineer, I want Vue components that render the tonal strips and interactive contrast helpers so users can explore the generated ramps visually with the same behaviors found in the `temp/` prototype.

## Related Epic

## Deliverables

- [E3-F4-S1](./E3-F4-S1.md): Baseline tonal scale generation without blend color.
- [E3-F4-S2](./E3-F4-S2.md): Render full, extended key, and key tonal strips with contextual metadata.
- [E3-F4-S3](./E3-F4-S3.md): Hover interactions, contrast helper dots, and linked previews.
- [E3-F4-S4](./E3-F4-S4.md): Optional blend distribution visualization with Plotly overlay controls.
