# E1-F3-S1 Implement Vitest unit testing setup for Vue components and utilities

## User Story

As a developer, I want a ready-to-use Vitest setup for unit testing Vue components and utilities so that new features can be validated quickly with fast feedback.

## Related Epic

- [E1](./E1.md) – SaaS platform foundation epic for the scaffold and tooling effort.

## Related Feature

- [E1-F3](./E1-F3.md) – Testing foundations feature.

## Scope

- Install Vitest with Vue Test Utils, happy-dom/jsdom environment, and TypeScript support.
- Configure `vitest.config` (or Vite config) for alias resolution, coverage reporting, and Vue SFC handling.
- Add sample test(s) demonstrating component render and utility testing without business specifics.
- Provide npm scripts for `test`, `test:watch`, and `test:coverage`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `npm run test` executes and passes on the scaffold without additional setup.
- Tests can import via `@/` alias and handle Vuetify components without manual mocks where feasible.
- Coverage reporting works or is stubbed with configuration ready for CI consumption.
- Documentation notes how to write and run unit tests with Vitest.

## Notes

- Keep examples minimal; avoid asserting product behavior.
- Ensure compatibility with ESLint and TypeScript settings.
