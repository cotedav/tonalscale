# E1-F5-S2 Add PWA essentials: manifest, service worker registration, and offline-ready shell

## User Story

As a platform architect, I want foundational PWA capabilities so that the SaaS app can deliver installable, offline-friendly behavior from day one.

## Related Epic

- [E1](./E1.md) – SaaS platform foundation epic for the scaffold and tooling effort.

## Related Feature

- [E1-F5](./E1-F5.md) – Localization and PWA experience feature.

## Scope

- Configure Vite PWA plugin (or equivalent) with web app manifest (name, icons placeholders, theme colors).
- Add service worker registration with update prompt/notification hook stub.
- Ensure caching strategy placeholders exist without overcommitting to data policies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Manifest file is generated/bundled with basic metadata and placeholder icons; paths are documented.
- Service worker registers on app load and handles updates gracefully (e.g., logs or TODO hook) without breaking dev mode.
- PWA build passes Lighthouse installability criteria in development preview (where applicable) without UI polish requirements.
- README notes how to customize manifest, icons, and caching strategies later.

## Notes

- Keep caching minimal; avoid data persistence decisions.
- Coordinate with routing to ensure offline fallback does not assume future architecture.
