# E3-F1 Tailwind/Headless UI foundation feature

## Feature Statement

As a front-end architect, I want the tonal builder view scaffolded with Tailwind CSS and Headless UI primitives so the migration can proceed without Vuetify dependencies while faithfully porting the `temp/` prototype instead of rebuilding it.

- [E3-F1-S2](./E3-F1-S2.md): Move the Vuetify index demo to a dedicated scaffolding-demo route.
