# E1-F6-S1 Add shared utility libraries (Lodash, VueUse, Luxon) with usage guidelines

## User Story

As a developer, I want common utility libraries available and documented so that cross-cutting helpers (dates, composables, data transforms) can be implemented consistently.

## Related Epic

- [E1](./E1.md) – SaaS platform foundation epic for the scaffold and tooling effort.

## Related Feature

- [E1-F6](./E1-F6.md) – Shared utility libraries feature.

## Scope

- Ensure Lodash (or lodash-es), VueUse, and Luxon are installed with proper TypeScript typings.
- Create a utilities directory with starter examples showing recommended import patterns (tree-shaking friendly).
- Document guidance on when/how to use each library to avoid bloat.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Example utility modules demonstrate using Lodash (modular imports), VueUse composables, and Luxon date handling without business specifics.
- Bundles tree-shake unused helpers; build/test scripts remain functional.
- Documentation outlines performance considerations and preferred patterns for imports.

## Notes

- Avoid over-engineering; focus on availability and responsible usage.
- Coordinate examples with ESLint/Prettier rules to ensure consistency.
