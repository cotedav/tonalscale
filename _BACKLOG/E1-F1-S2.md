# E1-F1-S2 Configure Vite/TypeScript project settings, path aliases, and environment handling

## User Story

As a developer, I want clear TypeScript and Vite configuration (including path aliases and environment variable loading) so that modules remain maintainable and builds behave predictably across environments.

## Related Epic

- [E1](./E1.md) – SaaS platform foundation epic for the scaffold and tooling effort.

## Related Feature

- [E1-F1](./E1-F1.md) – Project scaffold and configuration feature.

## Scope

- Configure `tsconfig` for strict type-checking, absolute path aliases (e.g., `@/`), and JSX/TSX support if needed by Vue tooling.
- Align Vite config with aliases and environment variable prefixes (e.g., `VITE_`) and document base URL handling.
- Add `env.example` documenting required environment variables without secrets.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `tsconfig` enforces strict mode and defines shared path aliases consistent with Vite config.
- Vite config resolves aliases and loads environment variables using official Vite conventions.
- `env.example` exists with placeholders and short comments; actual `.env` files are gitignored.
- Documentation in README or dedicated note clarifies how to add new env vars and use aliases.

## Notes

- Avoid over-optimization; keep configuration minimal yet production-aware.
- Ensure compatibility with future testing tasks (Vitest/Cypress) for path resolution.
