# E3 Tonal scale builder migration epic

## Epic Statement

As a design systems team, we want the tonal scale mini app ported into our Vue 3 scaffold with Tailwind CSS and Headless UI so that designers and engineers can iterate on accessible color ramps without relying on the legacy prototype.

## Goals

- Rebuild the tonal scale experience as Vue 3 components using Tailwind CSS and Headless UI instead of Vuetify.
- Preserve and harden the color science engine (LAB-based tonal generation, blending, easing) with TypeScript coverage.
- Deliver interaction-rich visualizations (scales, hover helpers, contrast previews) that match the current prototype behaviors.
- Ship reliable sharing utilities (URL sync, import/export, clipboard) and theming parity for light/dark modes.

## Deliverables

- [E3-F1](./E3-F1.md): Tailwind/Headless UI foundation for the tonal builder page.
- [E3-F2](./E3-F2.md): Color input and blending control surfaces.
- [E3-F3](./E3-F3.md): Tonal generation and color math engine.
- [E3-F4](./E3-F4.md): Scale visualization and interaction patterns.
- [E3-F5](./E3-F5.md): Accessibility helpers, clipboard, and sharing utilities.
- [E3-F6](./E3-F6.md): Theming, responsiveness, and UX polish.
