# E3-F2-S1 Base and blend color pickers with synchronized inputs

## User Story

As a designer, I want base and blend color pickers with hex, HSV, and RGB inputs so I can seed tonal ramps and overlays just like the prototype.

## Related Feature

- [E3-F2](./E3-F2.md) – Color input and blending control surfaces feature.

## Scope

- Build two Vue components (base picker and blend picker) using iro.js or an equivalent library to capture hue values for tonal generation and overlay blending.
- Support hex text entry with validation plus HSV/RGB slider modes; keep all representations synchronized across pickers and preview swatches.
- Emit reactive events when colors change and handle window resize to keep pickers responsive.
- Expose props/emitters to integrate with the tonal scale state composables.
- Decouple picker instantiation from tonal generation by keeping UI-only logic inside the components (unlike the prototype’s `updateScale()` calls and global resize listeners in `index.js`) so stores/composables handle orchestration instead of direct DOM hooks.【F:temp/src/js/index.js†L1-L17】【F:temp/src/js/index.js†L161-L174】

## Acceptance Criteria

- The tonal builder view shows two distinct pickers; changing either updates its preview swatch and propagates color data to shared state.
- Hex, HSV, and RGB inputs remain in sync; invalid hex input is guarded with user feedback and does not corrupt state.
- Picker widgets resize responsively and continue to emit change events after viewport resizes.
- Picker components publish typed events/props rather than calling scale generators directly, allowing stores/composables to orchestrate side effects.
- Unit or component tests cover bi-directional sync between text input and slider values.

## Notes

- Mirror the picker behaviors, validation, and UI flows present in the `temp/` tonal builder—this is a direct port, not a redesign.
- Implement with separation of concerns so picker files do not import or mutate the tonal engine; wiring happens through injected handlers to avoid the prototype’s monolithic script patterns.【F:temp/src/js/components/myIroPicker.js†L132-L181】【F:temp/src/js/index.js†L433-L438】
