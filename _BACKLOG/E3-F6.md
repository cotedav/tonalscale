# E3-F6 Theming, responsiveness, and UX polish feature

## Feature Statement

As a user experience lead, I want the tonal builder to respect light/dark themes, responsive layouts, and feedback cues so the interface feels production-ready while matching the `temp/` prototype behaviors 1:1.

## Deliverables

- [E3-F6-S1](./E3-F6-S1.md): Light/dark theme toggle with persisted preference and animated iconography.
- [E3-F6-S2](./E3-F6-S2.md): Responsive layout, focus management, and toast/alert feedback patterns.
