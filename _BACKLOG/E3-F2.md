# E3-F2 Color input and blending control surfaces feature

## Feature Statement

As a designer, I want precise color pickers and blending controls in Vue so I can generate tonal ramps with the same flexibility as the `temp/` prototype, ported 1:1 into the scaffold without redesign.

## Related Epic

## Deliverables

- [E3-F2-S1](./E3-F2-S1.md): Base and blend color pickers with synchronized inputs.
- [E3-F2-S2](./E3-F2-S2.md): Blend mode, strength, and saturation controls wired to reactive state.
