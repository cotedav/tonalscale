# E2 Observability, analytics, and resilience epic

## Epic Statement

As the platform team, we want production-ready observability, analytics, rollout guardrails, and offline resilience baked into the scaffold so that we can ship features confidently with clear insight into stability and user behavior.

## Goals

- Capture navigation, performance, and experiment data via Statsig without blocking app startup.
- Provide user-visible PWA update and offline experiences aligned with our service worker lifecycle.
- Define sensible caching, error monitoring, and CI health checks that keep the scaffold reliable.
- Enforce authentication/entitlement guardrails with feature-flag gates for progressive rollout.

## Deliverables

- [E2-F1](./E2-F1.md): Analytics and performance tracing with Statsig.
- [E2-F2](./E2-F2.md): Resilience and offline experience foundations.
- [E2-F3](./E2-F3.md): Authentication and feature-flag guardrails with Statsig.
- [E2-F4](./E2-F4.md): Delivery health instrumentation.
- [E2-F5](./E2-F5.md): Sentry monitoring for errors, releases, and performance.
