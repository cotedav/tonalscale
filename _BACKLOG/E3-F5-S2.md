# E3-F5-S2 Context menu shortcuts and clipboard exports for colors and SVG

## User Story

As a product designer, I want quick clipboard actions for hovered colors and AA/AAA pairs, including SVG export, so I can paste assets into design tools.

## Related Epic

- [E3](./E3.md) – Tonal scale builder migration epic.

## Related Feature

- [E3-F5](./E3-F5.md) – Accessibility helpers, clipboard, and sharing utilities feature.

## Scope

- Implement a custom context menu triggered on right-click over scale strips offering copy actions for hovered color and nearest AA/AAA pairs.
- Add a “Copy SVG” action that captures visible scale strips (with URL and export JSON metadata) and writes to the clipboard.
- Provide visual feedback/toasts for successful copies and guard invalid states.
- Ensure clipboard helpers are accessible via keyboard shortcuts or buttons in addition to context menu.
- Rebuild clipboard flows so they consume reactive tonal state and virtualization outputs rather than scraping the DOM and globals as in the prototype implementation.【F:temp/src/js/index.js†L823-L895】【F:temp/src/js/index.js†L127-L159】

## Acceptance Criteria

- Right-clicking a swatch opens a menu with copy actions for the hovered color and AA/AAA pairs; selecting an option copies the hex value with confirmation feedback.
- Copy SVG generates an SVG containing all visible strips plus metadata and places it on the clipboard without blocking the UI.
- Clipboard operations gracefully handle unsupported browsers/permissions with user feedback.
- Tests (or documented manual steps) confirm color copy, pair copy, and SVG copy behaviors for representative scales.
- Context menu and copy routines read from store data and component refs, keeping clipboard utilities framework-driven instead of manual DOM traversal.

## Notes

- Maintain the same menu entries, feedback, and export payloads used in the `temp/` app; rebuild with Tailwind/Headless UI but keep functionality 1:1.
