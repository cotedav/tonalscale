# E1-F4-S3 Integrate Vee-Validate with reusable form validation utilities

## User Story

As a developer, I want Vee-Validate configured with reusable helpers so that future forms can adopt consistent validation patterns without rewriting boilerplate.

## Related Epic

- [E1](./E1.md) – SaaS platform foundation epic for the scaffold and tooling effort.

## Related Feature

- [E1-F4](./E1-F4.md) – State, routing, and forms feature.

## Scope

- Install Vee-Validate and required peer dependencies for Vue 3 + TypeScript.
- Provide a basic validation plugin or helper module for registering global validation rules and composables.
- Add a sample form component demonstrating schema-based validation (non-domain-specific) with tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Vee-Validate is registered or easily imported within components with TypeScript typings enabled.
- Example form validates fields and displays generic messages without product-specific copy.
- Unit test(s) cover validation behavior using Vitest.
- Documentation describes how to define new schemas/rules and integrate with Vuetify inputs.

## Notes

- Keep messaging neutral and reusable; avoid UX commitments.
- Ensure compatibility with i18n for future localized error messages.
