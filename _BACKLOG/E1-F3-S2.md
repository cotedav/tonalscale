# E1-F3-S2 Implement Cypress end-to-end testing boilerplate for the PWA shell

## User Story

As a QA engineer, I want a Cypress setup aligned with the PWA scaffold so that end-to-end tests can validate core flows as they are introduced.

## Related Epic

- [E1](./E1.md) – SaaS platform foundation epic for the scaffold and tooling effort.

## Related Feature

- [E1-F3](./E1-F3.md) – Testing foundations feature.

## Scope

- Add Cypress (latest) with TypeScript support and basic configuration for component/e2e modes as appropriate.
- Configure base URL, folder structure, and scripts to run Cypress headless and headed.
- Provide a smoke test that opens the root page and verifies the placeholder shell loads.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `npm run cypress:open` and `npm run cypress:run` (or similar) execute successfully against the dev server or static preview.
- Example test uses recommended selectors and avoids product-specific assertions.
- Cypress config recognizes Vite aliases and works with Vuetify styles.
- Documentation explains how to start the app for e2e runs and how to add new specs.

## Notes

- Keep tests lightweight to avoid slow pipelines.
- Ensure compatibility with future routing updates.
