# E3-F1-S1 Configure Tailwind CSS and Headless UI while removing Vuetify usage

## User Story

As a front-end architect, I want Tailwind CSS and Headless UI configured in the Vue scaffold, replacing Vuetify, so the tonal builder can ship with our preferred utility-first and headless component stack.

## Related Epic

- [E3](./E3.md) – Tonal scale builder migration epic.

## Related Feature

- [E3-F1](./E3-F1.md) – Tailwind/Headless UI foundation feature.

## Scope

- Add Tailwind CSS with required Vite/PostCSS configuration, design tokens, and base typography/colors appropriate for the tonal builder.
- Install and register Headless UI Vue components for accessible dialogs, menus, and transitions used by the app.
- Remove Vuetify dependencies, plugins, and references from the project bootstrap and scripts.
- Provide minimal example usage (e.g., a Headless UI dialog stub) to confirm the stack is wired without blocking later UI work.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tailwind config and global styles compile under `npm run build` with no Vuetify imports remaining in the app entry point.
- Headless UI is available for modal and menu usage with at least one sample component verified via Storybook-equivalent preview or the dev page.
- ESLint/TypeScript configurations reflect Tailwind/Headless UI usage (no unused Vuetify rules or types).
- Documentation in the README or comments notes the migration away from Vuetify and the location of Tailwind theme tokens.

## Notes

- Keep custom CSS minimal; prefer Tailwind utilities for spacing and layout to ease future maintenance.
- Configuration must enable a direct port of the existing `temp/` tonal builder UI and interactions without reimplementing behaviors from scratch; the prototype remains the source of truth.
