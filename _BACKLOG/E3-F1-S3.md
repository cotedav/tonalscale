# E3-F1-S3 Rewrite the scaffolding demo with Tailwind/Headless UI and repair tests

## User Story

As a front-end architect, I want the scaffolding demo rewritten with Tailwind CSS and Headless UI so the reference page matches our new stack and its tests keep passing without Vuetify dependencies.

## Related Epic

- [E3](./E3.md) – Tonal scale builder migration epic.

## Related Feature

- [E3-F1](./E3-F1.md) – Tailwind/Headless UI foundation feature.

## Scope

- Replace Vuetify components in the scaffolding demo with Tailwind utility classes and Headless UI primitives while preserving layout and interactions showcased in the original sample.
- Remove Vuetify imports/usages from the demo route and ensure shared plugins/config are not required for this page.
- Update Cypress specs and unit tests that cover the demo so selectors, assertions, and snapshots align with the Tailwind/Headless UI markup.
- Adjust fixtures or helper utilities if they relied on Vuetify-specific DOM structure or theme tokens.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The `/scaffolding-demo` page renders using Tailwind/Headless UI with visual parity to the prior Vuetify demo (spacing, typography, component affordances) and no Vuetify bundles loaded.
- `npm run test` and targeted Cypress suites exercising the demo pass without Vuetify-related failures; updated snapshots/selectors reflect the new markup.
- Story remains localized and accessible (ARIA labels/roles preserved or improved) with no console warnings during dev server or Cypress runs.
- Documentation snippets referencing the demo reflect the Tailwind/Headless UI implementation and note the removal of Vuetify dependencies.

## Notes

- Keep Tailwind class usage consistent with the tokens defined in the Tailwind config from E3-F1-S1; avoid custom CSS unless necessary for parity.
- Preserve the exact behaviors and content from the `temp/` demo while swapping in Tailwind/Headless UI so the migration remains a port, not a redesign.
