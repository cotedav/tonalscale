# E2-F3-S1 MSAL authentication foundation for Azure AD readiness

## User Story

As a platform engineer, I want the scaffold wired for Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) so that Azure AD-integrated sign-in flows can be added without reworking the app shell.

## Related Epic

- [E2](./E2.md) – Observability, analytics, and resilience epic.

## Related Feature

- [E2-F3](./E2-F3.md) – Guardrails and rollout safety feature.

## Scope

- Add MSAL browser dependencies and initialize a client/provider suitable for Vue 3.
- Provide environment-driven configuration (tenant/client IDs, authority, redirect URI) with placeholders in `.env.example`.
- Expose a lightweight authentication composable or plugin stub to request tokens and share session state for future guarded routes.
- Include a sample protected route or guard placeholder that demonstrates how authentication would be enforced once enabled.
- Document how to supply credentials locally and how to disable auth for non-SSO environments (tests, CI).

## Acceptance Criteria

- MSAL initialization is encapsulated in a reusable module/composable and uses configuration pulled from environment variables.
- Application bootstrap includes optional MSAL wiring without blocking local development when credentials are absent.
- A sample guard or helper shows how routes/components would trigger sign-in or token acquisition without exposing secrets.
- `.env.example` lists required Azure AD settings with brief descriptions; README references the auth configuration path.
- Unit and lint workflows remain green with MSAL wiring included.

## Notes

- Keep the experience minimal—no need to build UI screens beyond placeholders demonstrating where login could be invoked.
- Align naming with existing router/store conventions so future auth flows can extend the scaffold cleanly.
