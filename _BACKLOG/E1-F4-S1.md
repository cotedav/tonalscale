# E1-F4-S1 Scaffold Pinia state management integration with type-safe store utilities

## User Story

As an application developer, I want Pinia wired into the Vue app with type-safe store patterns so that future stateful features can be added consistently.

## Related Epic

- [E1](./E1.md) – SaaS platform foundation epic for the scaffold and tooling effort.

## Related Feature

- [E1-F4](./E1-F4.md) – State, routing, and forms feature.

## Scope

- Install and register Pinia in the app entry.
- Provide a starter store module (e.g., app shell/global settings) demonstrating state, getters, and actions with TypeScript typing.
- Document recommended store structure, naming, and plugin registration approach.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Pinia is initialized in the main app bootstrap file and works with Vue Devtools.
- Example store compiles and can be imported via aliases; includes a minimal unit test under Vitest.
- Guidance notes where to place future stores and how to type actions/state.
- No business logic; example focuses on scaffolding only.

## Notes

- Keep the example minimal; avoid committing to domain models.
- Ensure compatibility with Vite hot module replacement.
