# E1-F4-S2 Create routing foundation with Vue Router ready for future route definitions

## User Story

As a frontend engineer, I want Vue Router initialized with a scalable structure so that future routes can be added without refactoring the scaffold.

## Related Epic

- [E1](./E1.md) – SaaS platform foundation epic for the scaffold and tooling effort.

## Related Feature

- [E1-F4](./E1-F4.md) – State, routing, and forms feature.

## Scope

- Install/configure Vue Router with history mode appropriate for a PWA.
- Set up a base router file with lazy-loadable route placeholders and a layout/shell view stub.
- Include navigation guards or middleware hooks as no-op placeholders, documented for future use.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Router is registered in the Vue app bootstrap and operates with the placeholder routes.
- Example route demonstrates lazy loading without tying to business flows; 404/fallback route stub exists.
- Routing configuration coexists with Vite path aliases and TypeScript typings.
- Documentation explains how to add new routes and guards later.

## Notes

- Do not encode navigation structure beyond placeholders.
- Keep guard logic minimal (logging or TODOs only).
