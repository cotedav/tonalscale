# E3-F1-S2 Move the Vuetify index demo to a dedicated scaffolding-demo route

## User Story

As a front-end architect, I want the current Vuetify-based index demo relocated into a dedicated `/scaffolding-demo` route so the tonal builder can claim the home path without losing our reference scaffolding page.

## Related Epic

- [E3](./E3.md) – Tonal scale builder migration epic.

## Related Feature

- [E3-F1](./E3-F1.md) – Tailwind/Headless UI foundation feature.

## Scope

- Add a named Vue Router entry for `/scaffolding-demo` and move the existing index demo view/template into that route.
- Preserve the demo’s content, navigation affordances, and data-cy selectors so current tests and documentation remain coherent while it still uses Vuetify.
- Update top-level routing to prepare for the tonal builder to own the root path, including redirects or navigation links that keep the demo reachable.
- Document the new route location in developer notes or README snippets referenced by the scaffold.
- Refactor prototype-only globals (resize listeners, theme toggles, and picker wiring) into view-scoped Vue components so relocating the demo does not register DOM handlers that interfere with the tonal builder route.【F:temp/src/js/index.js†L1-L34】

## Acceptance Criteria

- Visiting `/scaffolding-demo` renders the former index demo content with no broken links, assets, or console errors.
- The root path is free for the tonal builder route or clearly redirects to the new demo location without loops.
- Routing and navigation updates are covered by refreshed unit or router tests to confirm the path change and route naming.
- Cypress specs that previously visited the index demo continue to run against the new route without failures attributable to missing elements.
- Demo-specific event handlers are scoped to the demo route (no window-level listeners that would affect the builder page), replacing the prototype’s document-bound listeners with Vue lifecycle-safe equivalents.【F:temp/src/js/index.js†L1-L34】

## Notes

- Keep this story focused on relocation only; the visual conversion to Tailwind/Headless UI happens in the next story.
- Treat the existing index demo from `temp/` as the canonical reference—relocate it without altering behaviors so later Tailwind conversion can port the same UI 1:1.
