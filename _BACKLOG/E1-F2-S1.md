# E1-F2-S1 Set up ESLint (Airbnb) and Stylelint with Vue/TypeScript support and Prettier compatibility

## User Story

As a team lead, I want consistent linting based on Airbnb standards tailored for Vue 3 + TypeScript plus style linting so that code quality remains high and contributors share a common style across scripts and styles.

## Related Epic

- [E1](./E1.md) – SaaS platform foundation epic for the scaffold and tooling effort.

## Related Feature

- [E1-F2](./E1-F2.md) – Code quality and workflow automation feature.

## Scope

- Install and configure ESLint with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Airbnb presets.
- Add Stylelint with a Vue-friendly configuration covering CSS/SCSS inside SFCs and standalone stylesheets.
- Integrate Prettier via ESLint configs (disable conflicting rules, enable prettier plugin/extends).
- Provide npm scripts for `lint` and `lint:fix` covering source, style, and test files.

## Acceptance Criteria

- ESLint config extends Airbnb (or Airbnb-base) plus Vue and TypeScript rules; Prettier compatibility is ensured through appropriate extends/plugins.
- Stylelint config enforces modern CSS/SCSS conventions with Vue single-file component support and does not conflict with Prettier.
- Lint scripts run successfully on a clean scaffold, covering `.ts`, `.vue`, style assets, and test files.
- `.eslintignore` and `.stylelintignore` exclude build outputs and generated artifacts.
- README (or linting doc) briefly explains how to run and fix lint issues for both ESLint and Stylelint.

## Notes

- Prefer minimal overrides; document any necessary deviations from Airbnb defaults.
- Ensure configuration works with Vite, Vitest, and Cypress file patterns.
