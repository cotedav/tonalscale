# Backlog contribution rules

- When implementing a backlog item, read any files it references to ensure full context.
- Before marking a backlog task as complete, update the relevant status in `_BACKLOG/backlog.md`.
- When adding or editing backlog items, follow the naming hierarchy and INVEST guidance in `_DOC/standards/backlog-naming-and-invest.md`.
