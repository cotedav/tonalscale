# E3-F4-S2 Hover interactions, contrast helper dots, and linked previews

## User Story

As a UI engineer, I want hover interactions that surface AA/AAA candidates and preview cards so users can quickly assess accessible pairings.

## Related Epic

- [E3](./E3.md) – Tonal scale builder migration epic.

## Related Feature

- [E3-F4](./E3-F4.md) – Scale visualization and interaction patterns feature.

## Scope

- Enable hover and mousewheel interactions on scale strips to reveal contrast helper dots for darker/lighter sides and highlight the nearest AA/AAA options.
- Wire hover state to update linked preview cards with candidate color pairs and reset when no valid pair exists.
- Ensure interactions are keyboard-accessible (focus/arrow keys) and remain performant during rapid hover/mousewheel events.
- Provide visual affordances for active hover state, helper dots, and selected pairs.
- Move helper-dot and preview logic into composables/components instead of inline closures that directly poke the DOM, keeping interaction state decoupled from rendering.【F:temp/src/js/index.js†L621-L706】【F:temp/src/js/index.js†L621-L707】

## Acceptance Criteria

- Hovering or focusing a swatch displays helper dots indicating available AA/AAA matches on both sides and highlights the selected pairing.
- Preview cards update live with the hovered/selected pair and clear when focus leaves or no valid pair exists.
- Mousewheel interactions adjust preview selection as in the prototype without jitter; keyboard navigation is supported for accessibility.
- Tests cover helper dot rendering logic and preview updates based on hover/focus inputs.
- Interaction handlers emit through state or event buses rather than mutating DOM nodes directly, enabling isolated unit tests.

## Notes

- Hover mechanics, helper dots, and preview behaviors should be identical to the `temp/` implementation; rebuild them with Tailwind/Headless UI without changing user experience.
