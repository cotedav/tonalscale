# E3-F4-S2 Render full, extended key, and key tonal strips with contextual metadata

## User Story

As a UI engineer, I want Vue components that render the tonal strips with indices, hex values, and base luminance markers so users can see the generated ramp structure.

## Related Feature

- [E3-F4](./E3-F4.md) – Scale visualization and interaction patterns feature.

## Scope

- Build components to display the 101-step full strip, extended key strip, and key strip derived from the tonal state.
- Each swatch should show its index, hex value, and an indicator for the base luminance value, styled with Tailwind.
- Include zoom/hover affordances for swatches and optional hex popovers for readability.
- Ensure strips remain responsive and scrollable while preserving contrast-friendly labels in light/dark modes.
- Avoid imperative DOM manipulation used in the prototype renderer (query/select/remove nodes); consume reactive strip data from composables so the visualization layer stays declarative.【F:temp/src/js/index.js†L557-L619】【F:temp/src/js/index.js†L601-L619】

## Acceptance Criteria

- All three strips render from live tonal state; base luminance is visibly marked across strips.
- Swatches display index and hex values legibly; popovers or enlarged hover states improve readability without obstructing neighbors.
- Layout adapts to various viewport widths without clipping strip content or labels.
- Component tests cover rendering of indices, hex values, and base marker placement for representative tonal data.
- Strips subscribe to store/composable data and never mutate DOM directly (no manual element removal/append), keeping rendering logic testable.

## Notes

- Match the strip visuals, labels, and hover affordances from the `temp/` app exactly while implementing them with Tailwind/Headless UI components.
