# E1-F2-S3 Define npm scripts and CI-friendly workflows for build, lint, and tests

## User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want standardized npm scripts and a CI-ready workflow so that builds, linting, and tests run consistently locally and in pipelines.

## Related Epic

- [E1](./E1.md) – SaaS platform foundation epic for the scaffold and tooling effort.

## Related Feature

- [E1-F2](./E1-F2.md) – Code quality and workflow automation feature.

## Scope

- Consolidate npm scripts for linting, formatting, type-checking, unit tests, e2e tests, build, and preview.
- Provide a sample CI configuration stub (e.g., GitHub Actions YAML) that runs lint, test, and build steps using npm.
- Add documentation on recommended command sequences for local development and CI caching strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `package.json` scripts cover lint, format, type-check, unit tests, e2e tests, build, and preview with clear names.
- CI stub executes the scripted steps without referencing product-specific secrets; caches npm dependencies when possible.
- README (or workflow doc) explains how to run the scripts locally and how CI is expected to call them.
- Scripts align with ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, and Cypress setups without duplication.

## Notes

- Keep CI config minimal but functional; avoid vendor lock-in beyond a sensible default.
- Ensure scripts fail fast with non-zero exit codes on errors.
