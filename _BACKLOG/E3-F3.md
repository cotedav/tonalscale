# E3-F3 Tonal generation and color math engine feature

## Feature Statement

As a developer, I want the tonal scale math from `temp/` ported into typed Vue composables so that color ramps remain accurate, testable, and extensible without changing behavior.

## Related Epic

## Deliverables

- [E3-F3-S1](./E3-F3-S1.md): Port LAB-based tonal generation, easing, and blending utilities to TypeScript with tests.
- [E3-F3-S2](./E3-F3-S2.md): Expose reusable composables/services for tonal scale state and derivations.
