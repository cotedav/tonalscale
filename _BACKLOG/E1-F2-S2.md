# E1-F2-S2 Establish Prettier formatting standards and developer workflow automation

## User Story

As a contributor, I want automated formatting with Prettier so that code style stays consistent across the repo with minimal manual effort.

## Related Epic

- [E1](./E1.md) – SaaS platform foundation epic for the scaffold and tooling effort.

## Related Feature

- [E1-F2](./E1-F2.md) – Code quality and workflow automation feature.

## Scope

- Add a Prettier configuration (shared for TS, Vue, JSON, Markdown) aligned with ESLint setup.
- Configure `.prettierignore` for build outputs and generated files.
- Introduce developer automation (e.g., npm script and optional lint-staged/husky hook) to enforce formatting on commit.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Prettier config file exists with sensible defaults compatible with ESLint settings.
- Running `npm run format` (or equivalent) formats source, test, and config files without errors.
- If git hooks are added, they run locally without blocking CI; instructions explain how to enable/disable.
- Documentation notes how to apply formatting in daily workflow.

## Notes

- Keep automation lightweight; avoid enforcing UI or business conventions.
- Ensure compatibility with IDE integrations for Vue SFCs.
