# E2-F5-S1 Sentry integration for error, release, and performance monitoring

## User Story

As an engineering manager, I want Sentry capturing errors, releases, and performance traces so that production issues are actionable with clear context and alerts.

## Related Epic

- [E2](./E2.md) – Observability, analytics, and resilience epic.

## Related Feature

- [E2-F5](./E2-F5.md) – Monitoring and alerting feature.

## Scope

- Integrate the Sentry SDK for Vue/TypeScript with DSN and environment configuration externalized (no secrets committed).
- Enable release tracking, source map upload strategy, and performance tracing tailored to SPA navigation.
- Configure sampling, PII-scrubbing, and breadcrumb policies aligned with privacy/security guidance.
- Add alerting/documentation for triage workflows and local/development opt-out mechanisms.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Sentry initializes during app startup without blocking rendering and respects environment toggles (enabled in staging/prod, disabled in local by default).
- Errors and unhandled promise rejections are captured with breadcrumbs and app context; performance traces include route-level spans.
- Release/version information is attached to events, and source map guidance or automation is documented for build pipelines.
- Data-sanitization rules prevent PII leakage; sampling rates are documented and configurable.
- Tests (unit or integration) verify that initialization respects configuration and that a simulated error is reported when enabled.

## Notes

- Coordinate with CI/release processes when implementing source map uploads; keep docs synced with the chosen deployment flow.
