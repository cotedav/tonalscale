# E3-F5-S3 Import/Export modal and URL synchronization for sharable configurations

## User Story

As a product designer, I want to export and restore tonal builder setups via JSON and sharable URLs so I can collaborate with teammates and revisit past ramps.

## Related Epic

- [E3](./E3.md) – Tonal scale builder migration epic.

## Related Feature

- [E3-F5](./E3-F5.md) – Accessibility helpers, clipboard, and sharing utilities feature.

## Scope

- Implement a modal (Headless UI dialog) that serializes current scale parameters to JSON and accepts pasted JSON to restore state with validation/alerts for invalid payloads.
- Synchronize current settings with the URL query string, validated against defaults, to enable shareable links that restore state on load.
- Ensure imports/URL loads update color pickers, controls, and scales in one flow without partial state.
- Provide user feedback for successful imports and invalid payloads; prevent corrupt state from applying.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Export modal shows serialized JSON reflecting current parameters; copying/pasting that JSON back restores the identical setup.
- Invalid JSON inputs are rejected with clear messaging; valid imports trigger full state regeneration and refresh the UI.
- URL query parameters reflect current settings and restore state on page load, including pickers, controls, and scales.
- Tests cover JSON validation, successful import/export cycles, and URL sync for a sample configuration.

## Notes

- Keep the import/export schema and URL parameters identical to the `temp/` app; implementation should port the experience 1:1 onto Headless UI/Tailwind.
