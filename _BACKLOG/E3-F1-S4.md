# E3-F1-S4 Build the tonal builder home page shell and layout scaffolding

## User Story

As a front-end architect, I want the tonal builder to own the home page with responsive layout scaffolding so subsequent components can drop in without reworking the page structure.

## Related Epic

- [E3](./E3.md) – Tonal scale builder migration epic.

## Related Feature

- [E3-F1](./E3-F1.md) – Tailwind/Headless UI foundation feature.

## Scope

- Create the Vue Router view for the tonal builder at the root path, using Tailwind to define columnar regions for controls, scale previews, and accessibility helpers identical to the prototype layout in `temp/`.
- Stub slots/placeholder components for pickers, control panel, scale strips, accessibility cards, and modals.
- Ensure the layout accommodates hover zoom, popovers, and context menus without overflow clipping.
- Provide basic SEO metadata and page title hooks appropriate for the builder.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Navigating to the home page renders a responsive grid or flex layout with placeholders representing all major sections from the prototype (pickers, controls, strips, cards, modals).
- Tailwind classes handle spacing, breakpoints, and scroll behavior without reliance on Vuetify containers.
- The page shell includes head/title configuration and ARIA landmarks (e.g., main, aside) for accessibility scaffolding.
- No visual regressions block later component integration (e.g., popovers/menus have adequate stacking context).

## Notes

- Keep custom CSS minimal; prefer Tailwind utilities for spacing and layout to ease future maintenance.
- Story sequencing assumes the scaffolding demo has been relocated and converted to Tailwind in E3-F1-S2 and E3-F1-S3.
- All layout regions and placeholders must mirror the behaviors and structure of the `temp/` tonal builder so functionality can be ported 1:1 instead of rebuilt from scratch.
